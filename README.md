# BlinkRC7

This project targets a PIC16F18345 and turns a LED (connected to RC7) on or off based on command received over serial port connected to pins RA0 (RX) and RA1 (TX)

It is a mix of two existing tutorials:

The chip configuration came from the tutorial on [MPLab Cloud](https://mplabxpress.microchip.com/mplabcloud/example/details/312)

The serial communication demo code comes from the USART Serial Communication tutorial on [Microchip Developer](http://microchipdeveloper.com/mcu1101:project-12)
